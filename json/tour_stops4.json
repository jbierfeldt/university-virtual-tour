The inscription, which Mrs. Bond composed, reads: “Erected in Memory of Joseph Bond for the Worship of God and the Service of Man, 1926.” A section of the wood paneling near the tablet has been carved to read “Peace I Leave With You.”<br /><br />Since it’s construction in 1926, Swift Hall has housed the departments relating to theology and religion, including the University of Chicago Divinity School. Bond Chapel is used both for multi-denominational religious service and private events like weddings for University affiliated individuals. The basement of the building is the home of student favorite coffee shop “Grounds of Being” where the slogan is “Where God Drinks Coffee.”<br /><br />More info: https://divinity.uchicago.edu/bond-chapel",

The building is one of the centers of undergraduate education; it’s almost impossible to graduate without taking a class here eventually.<br /><br />Cobb Lecture Hall was the first University of Chicago building completed when the University first held classes on October 1, 1892. The building was modeled after the Gothic style featured prominently on the Oxford University campus in England, and it was the most expensive of the original sixteen buildings. It included a “general recitation” hall and a chapel in addition to classrooms and offices.<br /><br />Cobb Lecture Hall faces inward toward the main quadrangle, leaving its street-side façade sparse. Its interior design is largely utilitarian, reflecting Cobb’s Chicago School influences, though inflections of Gothic revival are still apparent.<br /><br />After the School of Social Service Administration was finished south of the Midway and its related offices moved, Cobb Lecture Hall became entirely dedicated to the humanities and social sciences. The Center for the Study of Languages, The Film Studies Center, the Language Center, and the Renaissance Society are all headquartered here.",
