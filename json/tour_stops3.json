"info": "Rosenwald Hall was built to house the Geology and Geography departments, so the outside is covered with imagery of people and objects related to those pursuits. Julius Rosenwald, president of Sears, Roebuck, granted the University $250,000 to construct the building. After the aforementioned departments, Rosenwald housed the business school from 1972 until it moved to its current location.",

Most  were sent to the Field Museum in the 1920s, but some fossils remained until the 1980s, when the Booth School of Business expanded into the Museum from its home in Rosenwald.

The chapel contains a bronze plaque designed by the famous sculptor Lorado Taft that was originally donated by Mrs. Joseph Bond in memory of her husband, who served as a trustee for the Baptist Theological Union (predecessor of the Divinity School). The inscription, which Mrs. Bond composed, reads: “Erected in Memory of Joseph Bond for the Worship of God and the Service of Man, 1926.” A section of the wood paneling near the tablet has been carved to read “Peace I Leave With You.”<br /><br />Since it’s construction in 1926, Swift Hall has housed the departments relating to theology and religion, including the University of Chicago Divinity School. Bond Chapel is used both for multi-denominational religious service and private events like weddings for University affiliated individuals. The basement of the building is the home of student favorite coffee shop “Grounds of Being” where the slogan is “Where God Drinks Coffee.”<br /><br />More info: https://divinity.uchicago.edu/bond-chapel",

"info": "Cobb is the oldest building on campus, and the first designed by architect Henry Ives Cobb (no relation to Silas Cobb, the building’s namesake). The building is one of the centers of undergraduate education; it’s almost impossible to graduate without taking a class here eventually.<br /><br />Cobb Lecture Hall was the first University of Chicago building completed when the University first held classes on October 1, 1892. The building was modeled after the Gothic style featured prominently on the Oxford University campus in England, and it was the most expensive of the original sixteen buildings. It included a “general recitation” hall and a chapel in addition to classrooms and offices.<br /><br />Cobb Lecture Hall faces inward toward the main quadrangle, leaving its street-side façade sparse. Its interior design is largely utilitarian, reflecting Cobb’s Chicago School influences, though inflections of Gothic revival are still apparent.<br /><br />After the School of Social Service Administration was finished south of the Midway and its related offices moved, Cobb Lecture Hall became entirely dedicated to the humanities and social sciences. The Center for the Study of Languages, The Film Studies Center, the Language Center, and the Renaissance Society are all headquartered here.",
